# Neuralink – Making Mind and Machine Work Together

Neuralink is a futuristic tech company started in **2016 by Elon Musk** and a team of scientists.  
Its main goal is simple but powerful:

> **To connect the human brain with computers** — so people with paralysis can control devices just by thinking, and one day, even boost brain abilities.

## What is Neuralink Building?

The company has built a tiny brain chip called the **N1 Link** — also known as “Telepathy.”

- It’s **coin-sized** and goes inside the skull.
- It has **super-thin wires (electrodes)** that connect to the brain.
- These wires can **read brain signals** and send them to a computer **wirelessly**.
- A special robot (built by Neuralink) implants the device with high precision.

At first, it’s made for people who **can’t move or speak** — to help them use phones, computers, or even draw using just their thoughts.

## Big Milestones So Far

Neuralink has made fast progress in a short time:

- **2020** – Showed a pig with a brain chip that tracked its nose movements  
- **2021** – A monkey used the chip to play a video game using only its mind  
- **2023** – Got FDA approval to start human testing  
- **2024** – First person with paralysis got the chip and used it to browse the web  
- **2025** – More human trials, new chips for restoring **vision** and **speech**

## Human Trials: Helping People Move & Communicate Again

Neuralink is testing its chip on real people through something called the **PRIME Study**:

- People with **spinal injuries or ALS** are getting the implant
- They’ve used it to:
  - Move a mouse cursor  
  - Play games  
  - Design in 3D  
- By 2025, at least **5 people** (in the US & Canada) have received the chip

Future goals:
- Help them control **robotic arms**
- Restore **speech**
- Bring back **sight**

## Ethical Concerns & Safety Questions

Neuralink’s work is exciting — but also raises serious concerns:

- **Animal testing**: Investigations showed many animals died during experiments
- **Privacy risks**: Wireless brain data could be misused or even hacked
- **Surgery dangers**: Inserting anything in the brain is always risky
- **Not enough transparency**: Experts say Neuralink didn’t share enough research details at first
- **Fair access**: If this becomes a high-end product, only the rich might benefit

---

## Who Funds Neuralink?

- **Elon Musk** funded it with over **$100 million**  
- Later rounds brought big investments:
  - $205M in 2021
  - $650M in 2025 (led by ARK Invest, Google Ventures, Thrive, and others)
- Today, Neuralink is worth about **$9 billion**

## Competitors: Who Else is Working on Brain Tech?

| Company               | What Makes Them Different                      |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Synchron**          | Chip goes through a blood vessel — no brain surgery needed  
| **Paradromics**       | Very fast brain signal reading — good for ALS  
| **Precision Neuro**   | Chip lies on brain surface — easier to remove  
| **Blackrock**         | Academic tech — used in early brain trials  

Neuralink’s chip is **very advanced**, but it also involves **brain surgery**, unlike some others.

---

## What’s Next?

Neuralink is working on:

- Adding **more patients** to its trials  
- Making chips that help with **vision, speech, and movement**  
- Improving how thoughts are decoded — like **handwriting or full sentences**  
- Long-term: Possibly **boosting memory or brain speed** in healthy people (still just an idea)
