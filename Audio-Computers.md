## What Are Audio Computers?

Audio computers are **screenless, voice-first devices** that fit into your ears and function just like a mini computer — but instead of using a screen or keyboard, they operate entirely through **sound, voice commands, and smart audio processing**.

In simple words, it’s like having a virtual assistant (like Alexa or Siri), but much smarter and always with you — directly inside your ears. These devices are designed to let you **interact with AI, access information, translate languages, and control sound environments** — all using your voice.

## Overview

Unlike smartphones or laptops, audio computers **don’t need your eyes or hands**. Their goal is to **keep you present in the real world** while quietly enhancing your digital experience through sound.

Companies like **Iyo**, founded by Jason Rugolo, are building advanced **in-ear AI computers** that can act as a coach, translator, or even a therapist — all in real time, without needing a screen.

## Key Features

### 1. Always-On Voice Assistant  
Responds to your voice naturally — no need to say “Hey” or press buttons. It feels like you’re talking to a real human.

### 2. Smart Sound Filtering  
These devices can **reduce background noise**, **enhance important voices**, and let you hear only what you need — even in crowded places.

### 3. Real-Time Translation  
Speak in one language and hear the translation in your ear instantly — useful while traveling or during conversations with people from different countries.

### 4. Local AI Processing  
Many actions can be performed **without the internet**, as the AI runs directly on the device — making it faster and more private.

### 5. Hands-Free, Screen-Free Use  
You can talk, listen, and respond — all while walking, working, or driving. It’s built to **support your attention**, not steal it.
